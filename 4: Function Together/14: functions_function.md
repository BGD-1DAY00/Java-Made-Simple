## Introduction

In Java, methods are not stored as independent entities in memory. Instead, they are part of classes and are loaded into memory when their containing class is loaded. Understanding how methods are represented in memory is crucial for grasping Java's execution model.

## Method Area

The method area, also known as the Class Memory, is part of the JVM's memory structure where the bytecode of methods is stored.

- **Location**: Part of the non-heap memory
- **Content**:
    - Method bytecode
    - Runtime constant pool
    - Field and method data
    - Code for methods and constructors

## Stack Memory

The stack is used for method execution and storing local variables.

- **Function**: Stores frames for method invocations
- **Content of each frame**:
    - Local variables
    - Partial results
    - Return value
    - Operand stack

## Heap Memory

While methods themselves are not stored in the heap, objects (which contain method references) are.

- **Content**:
    - Objects
    - Instance variables

## Method Invocation

When a method is called:
1. A new frame is created on the stack
2. Parameters are passed to the new frame
3. The program counter moves to the method's bytecode in the method area
4. Local variables are created in the new frame
5. The method executes
6. After execution, the frame is popped off the stack

## Examples

Let's look at some examples to illustrate these concepts:

### Example 1: Simple Method Invocation

```java
public class SimpleMethod {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = add(5, 3);
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Memory representation:

```
Method Area:
+---------------------------+
| SimpleMethod class        |
| - main() method bytecode  |
| - add() method bytecode   |
+---------------------------+

Stack (during execution):
+---------------------------+
| main() frame              |
| - args: [String array ref]|
| - result: 8               |
+---------------------------+
| add() frame               |
| - a: 5                    |
| - b: 3                    |
+---------------------------+
```

### Example 2: Instance Method and Object

```java
public class Calculator {
    private int value;

    public Calculator(int initialValue) {
        this.value = initialValue;
    }

    public int add(int number) {
        value += number;
        return value;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator(10);
        int result = calc.add(5);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

Memory representation:

```
Method Area:
+---------------------------+
| Calculator class          |
| - main() method bytecode  |
| - add() method bytecode   |
| - Constructor bytecode    |
+---------------------------+

Heap:
+---------------------------+
| Calculator object         |
| - value: 15               |
+---------------------------+

Stack (during add() execution):
+---------------------------+
| main() frame              |
| - calc: [object reference]|
| - result: 15              |
+---------------------------+
| add() frame               |
| - this: [object reference]|
| - number: 5               |
+---------------------------+
```

### Example 3: Recursive Method

```java
public class Recursion {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return 1;
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = factorial(4);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

Memory representation (stack growth during recursion):

```
Method Area:
+---------------------------+
| Recursion class           |
| - main() method bytecode  |
| - factorial() method      |
+---------------------------+

Stack (at deepest recursion):
+---------------------------+
| main() frame              |
| - result: uninitialized   |
+---------------------------+
| factorial(4) frame        |
| - n: 4                    |
+---------------------------+
| factorial(3) frame        |
| - n: 3                    |
+---------------------------+
| factorial(2) frame        |
| - n: 2                    |
+---------------------------+
| factorial(1) frame        |
| - n: 1                    |
+---------------------------+
```

These examples illustrate how methods are stored in the method area and how method invocations create frames on the stack. The heap is involved when objects are created and instance methods are called.

Key points to remember:
1. Method bytecode is stored in the method area.
2. Each method invocation creates a new frame on the stack.
3. Local variables and parameters exist within stack frames.
4. Objects, which can contain method references, are stored in the heap.
5. Recursive methods create multiple frames on the stack, one f
